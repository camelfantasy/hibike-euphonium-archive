                the Liz and the Blue Bird discord server, with the goal of creating
                a comprehensive archive of all physical and digital visual
                content that have been created for the Hibike franchise.  All
                content is hosted <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1lqyNmKZy0LmnjOSv9jr8Um13MjZDhTh_">here</a>;
