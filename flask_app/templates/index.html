                This site is currently in beta.
                As such, there will be frequent updates to the site code (resulting in ocassional bugs and very brief downtimes),
                and many images (~30%) have not been properly tagged yet.
                <br>
                There is currently very limited resources devoted to both tasks, so it may be a while before all major features are implemented.
            </p>
            Thank you for your understanding.

                Tags' categories can be changed by adding a tag as usual but selecting a different category.
