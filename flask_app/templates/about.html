                The Hibike! Euphonium Archive project was created by members of
                the Liz and the Blue Bird discord server, with the goal of creating
                a comprehensive archive of all physical and digital visual
                content that have been created for the Hibike! franchise.  All
                files are hosted on Google Drive; this website is simply for search
                purposes.
